# AI Prompts Used & Reasoning

## Initial Project Setup

### Prompt 1: Project Initialization
**Prompt**: "Create a Next.js web application with CRUD functionality, login page, and deployment to Vercel. The app should include a simple object management system with forms containing text input, dropdown, and boolean fields, plus a view page with filtering and pagination."

**Reasoning**: Started with a high-level prompt to get the overall project structure and technology stack recommendation. This helped establish the foundation with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Schema Design

### Prompt 2: Data Model Design
**Internal reasoning**: Chose "Task" as the CRUD object because it's:
- Familiar to users (todos/task management)
- Rich enough to demonstrate all required field types
- Practical for real-world scenarios
- Allows for meaningful filtering and sorting

**Design decisions**:
- Used enums for status and priority (dropdown requirements)
- Added boolean flags for completion and urgency
- Included timestamps for audit trail
- Used UUID for unique identification

## Component Architecture

### Prompt 3: Authentication System
**Internal reasoning**: Implemented authentication because:
- Required by the assignment (login page)
- Needed to associate tasks with users
- Demonstrates security awareness
- Enables user-specific data filtering

**Implementation choice**: React Context + localStorage for simplicity while maintaining proper separation of concerns.

### Prompt 4: Form Design
**Internal reasoning**: TaskForm component designed to meet all requirements:
- Text input (title) - most common form field
- Textarea (description) - multi-line text input
- Select dropdowns (status, priority) - enum requirements
- Checkboxes (completed, urgent) - boolean requirements
- Proper validation and error handling

## UI/UX Decisions

### Prompt 5: Filtering & Pagination
**Internal reasoning**: Implemented comprehensive filtering because:
- Assignment requires "basic filtering"
- Added search functionality as value-add
- Multiple filter types demonstrate technical depth
- Pagination with configurable page sizes shows scalability awareness

**Features implemented**:
- Filter by status, priority, completion, urgency
- Text search across title and description
- Clear filters functionality
- 5/10/20 items per page options

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt 6: Data Persistence
**Internal reasoning**: Used localStorage because:
- No backend required for this assessment
- Persistent data between sessions
- Simulates real database operations
- Easy to implement and test

### Prompt 7: Error Handling
**Internal reasoning**: Added comprehensive error handling:
- Form validation with user feedback
- Loading states for better UX
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Try-catch blocks around data operations

## Code Quality Decisions

### Prompt 8: TypeScript Implementation
**Internal reasoning**: Heavy use of TypeScript because:
- Demonstrates type safety awareness
- Catches errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Shows professional development practices

### Prompt 9: Component Organization
**Internal reasoning**: Separated components by responsibility:
- LoginForm: Authentication only
- TaskForm: Create/edit functionality
- TaskList: Display and basic operations
- Navigation: App-wide navigation
- ProtectedRoute: Security wrapper

## Testing Considerations

### Prompt 10: Demo Data
**Internal reasoning**: Added demo data generation because:
- Enables immediate testing without manual data entry
- Shows realistic data scenarios
- Demonstrates edge cases (different priorities, statuses)
- Improves user experience during evaluation

## Deployment Preparation

### Prompt 11: Build Optimization
**Internal reasoning**: Ensured clean build process:
- No TypeScript errors
- Minimal ESLint warnings
- Optimized for static generation where possible
- Ready for Vercel deployment

## Value-Add Features Beyond Requirements

1. **Search functionality** - Goes beyond basic filtering
2. **Demo data generation** - Improves evaluation experience  
3. **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly interface
4. **Loading states** - Better user experience
5. **Confirmation dialogs** - Prevents accidental deletions
6. **Form validation** - Prevents invalid data entry
7. **Navigation component** - Professional app structure
8. **Protected routes** - Security best practices

## Prompt Strategy Summary

The AI prompts were designed to:
1. **Start broad** - Get overall architecture right
2. **Focus specific** - Address each requirement systematically  
3. **Add value** - Go beyond minimum requirements
4. **Ensure quality** - Implement best practices
5. **Think user** - Consider end-user experience
6. **Plan deployment** - Prepare for production use
